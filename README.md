# Python-3-Practise
A repository filled with my simple and mostly useless programs that I've made simply to practise my Python coding skills.

- Average Calculator: A simple script that will take all the values that you enter and calculate the mean, median, mode and range of them.

- Basic Password System: Short program that allows the password to cahnge and gives the user 3 attempts before lock out/the program ends.

- Divisors of Input: Short script that will output all the possible divisors of your input that leave no remainders.

- Even List: Generates a list of 20 random numbers from 1 to 100 and then prints a new list containing only the even numbers from the origional list.

- Factorial Calculator: A script that has two different functions, both of which find the factorial of the number you input. The first uses iteration and the second uses recursion.

- Fruit Shop: Takes 3 costs in a string as x y z and then 3 quantities as a b c and then the max cash and calculates the highest amount of objects that can be bought with those values.

- List Checker: Takes a preset list and prints all the values in it that are smaller than 5 and then smaller than the input from the user.

- List Overlap: Generates 2 random number lists, one longer than the other and then compares them to find what numbers appear in both lists. It puts these numbers in a new list and prints it.

- Multiply List by 1.1: Multiplies a set list by 1.1 and outputs the resulting list. Two different functions, one uses for and the other uses list compression.

- Name Guessing: Allows you to guess the name set in the code for as long as you want until you guess the name correctly, also provides output messages to tell you when youre wrong nd correct.

- Odd or Even: Despite the name it checks if it's a multiple of 4, even, odd and if it's divisible by the second number that was inputted.

- Palindrome Checker: A simple script to check if your input is a palindrome meaning the it looks the same as normal when reversed.

- Sentence Info: Takes an input and tells the user the number of charcters with and without spaces, the first and second half of the input, whether it is all uppercase, lowercase or neither and what it looks like in both those cases.

- Tower of Hanoi Moves: A program that allows you to input the number of rings and then outputs the least moves needed to fully move all the rings to another stick.

- Triangle Numbers: A short simple script that takes an input and finds all the triangle numbers up to and including your input and outputs them.

- Years until age 100: Takes the name, age and amount of times you want the output printed and from there finds and prints the number of years until you're 100, what year that will be and is customized with your name the amount of times you inputted.
