# Python-3-Practise
A repository filled with my simple and mostly useless programs that I've made simply to practise my Python coding skills.

-Average-Calculator: A simple script that will take all the values that you enter and calculate the mean, median, mode and range of them.

-Palindrome Checker: A simple script to check if your input is a palindrome meaning the it looks the same as normal when reversed.

-Tower of Hanoi Moves: A program that allows you to input the number of rings and then outputs the least moves needed to fully move all     the rings to another stick.
