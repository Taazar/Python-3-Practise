# Python-3-Practise
A repository filled with my simple and mostly useless programs that I've made simply to practise my Python coding skills.

- Average Calculator: A simple script that will take all the values that you enter and calculate the mean, median, mode and range of them.

- Basic Password System: Short program that allows the password to cahnge and gives the user 3 attempts before lock out/the program ends.

- Discount List by 10%: Takes a random list and prints a list where all the numbers have been decreased by 10%

- Divisors of Input: Short script that will output all the possible divisors of your input that leave no remainders.

- Even List: Generates a list of 20 random numbers from 1 to 100 and then prints a new list containing only the even numbers from the origional list.

- Factorial Calculator: A script that has two different functions, both of which find the factorial of the number you input. The first uses iteration and the second uses recursion.

- Fake Hack: Uses the time library and a bit of string manipulation to print some simple things to make it look like your hacking something to a noob

- Fibonacci: Prints a stream of fibonacci numbers. Amount printed is specified by user input.

- First And Last Of List: Generates a random list and then prints the first and last elements in that list.

- Fruit Shop: Takes 3 costs in a string as x y z and then 3 quantities as a b c and then the max cash and calculates the highest amount of objects that can be bought with those values.

- List Checker: Takes a preset list and prints all the values in it that are smaller than 5 and then smaller than the input from the user.

- List Overlap: Generates 2 random number lists, one longer than the other and then compares them to find what numbers appear in both lists. It puts these numbers in a new list and prints it.

- Loops and Format Test: Simply prints a series of messages with percentages on the end that increase each time by a certain amount.

- Multiply List by 1.1: Multiplies a set list by 1.1 and outputs the resulting list. Two different functions, one uses for and the other uses list compression.

- Name Guessing: Allows you to guess the name set in the code for as long as you want until you guess the name correctly, also provides output messages to tell you when youre wrong nd correct.

- Number Guessing Game: Picks a number between 1 and 9 and then counts how many attempts the user needs to get the number. It also tells the user if their guess is too low or too high.

- Odd or Even: Despite the name it checks if it's a multiple of 4, even, odd and if it's divisible by the second number that was inputted.

- Palindrome Checker: A simple script to check if your input is a palindrome meaning the it looks the same as normal when reversed.

- Password Strength: Function that takes an imput and then detects if it contains uppercase, lowercase and numeric characters and tells you the strenght of your passeord accordingly.

- Prime Checker: Checks if the number the user entered was a prime number. Has two ways to do this: one uses function recursion and the other uses loops.

- Rock Paper Scissors: Program that can play rock, paper, scissors. It has two modes: multiplayer and against the computer and it also alows you to change the names of the players and the computer.

- Sentence Info: Takes an input and tells the user the number of charcters with and without spaces, the first and second half of the input, whether it is all uppercase, lowercase or neither and what it looks like in both those cases.

- Sort List Without Sort Function: Generates a random list and then sorts it without using the built in sort function.

- Tower of Hanoi Moves: A program that allows you to input the number of rings and then outputs the least moves needed to fully move all the rings to another stick.

- Triangle Numbers: A short simple script that takes an input and finds all the triangle numbers up to and including your input and outputs them.

- Years until age 100: Takes the name, age and amount of times you want the output printed and from there finds and prints the number of years until you're 100, what year that will be and is customized with your name the amount of times you inputted.
