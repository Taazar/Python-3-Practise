# Python-3-Practise
A repository filled with my simple and mostly useless programs that I've made simply to practise my Python coding skills.

# Index
-Palindrome Checker: A simple script to check if your input is a palindrome meaning the it looks the same as normal when reversed.
-Tower of Hanoi Moves: A program that allows you to input the number of rings and then outputs the least moves needed to fully move all     the rings to another stick.
